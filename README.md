# PercolationSimulator
Monte Carlo Simulation for Percolation Threshold

In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability p (and therefore blocked with probability 1 âˆ’ p), what is the probability that the system percolates? When p equals 0, the system does not percolate; when p equals 1, the system percolates. This simulator aims to find the threshold p such that the system percolates.
